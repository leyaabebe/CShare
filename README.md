Myself, Amy, Meeka, Patricia, and Emma met and came together to collaborate on a WebVR project for The Expat Woman's All-Women Hackathon at Galvonize this past weekend. We wanted to create a platform where those new to or unable to afford VR headsets could come to test making scenes of their own and learn the coding behind it from their computers.

The underlying WebVR we used was A-frame. Unfortunately, since this was a short hackathon, we created an incomplete preview of the space. In it, one could pan around the scene, see the object that was being affected, and see where the code being written was posted along with a keyboard to show hand movement.

We each contributed to the concept, naming, & imagery. I was specifically responsible for the website we presented our concept with. The code for that site will live here. It definitely needs edits. So please feel free to help out wherever you see fit!
